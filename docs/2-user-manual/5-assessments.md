# Assessments

After questionnaires have been uploaded and a patient has been entered, assessments can be created from the patient centred-view, or, alternatively, from the ‘plan assessment’ menu in the navigation bar.   
To create an assessment, it needs a title (e.g., ‘baseline assessment’) and informant which can be of 3 types. 1) The patient himself/herself using a self-rating questionnaire, 2) a user of the MHIRA software which applies if expertise from another health care worker is required or 3) a caregiver which can then be selected from a dropdown. Assessments can be always open for completion or restricted to a time frame. For example, they could be planned to be filled in as a follow-up in which case they would be made available after a couple of months. Assessments can also be set to expire at a certain date after which they are no longer accessible. Finally, to create an assessment one or multiple questionnaires need to be selected. Once created the assessments have different statuses. If  ‘open for completion’ or ‘partially completed’, the assessments can be accessed via a public link.
